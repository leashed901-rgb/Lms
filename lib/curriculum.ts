        title: "Foundation — Dog Life, Breeds & Salon Safety",
        lesson:
          "You begin by learning to read the dog in front of you. Dogs move through life stages — puppy, adolescent, adult, senior — and each stage changes what grooming is safe and comfortable. You will learn to identify breed groups and coat types, because a Golden Retriever's double coat and a Poodle's curly coat demand different tools and techniques. Before you ever touch a dog, you master salon safety: how to lift and restrain without injury, how to read stress signals, and how to keep your station sanitary between dogs to prevent cross-contamination. IPDG-103 is a safety gate — you must be signed off before any live-animal work begins. This term also launches your Business & Personal Mastery spine: Life Skills, Personal Readiness, and the first Business and Marketing modules run alongside your technical blocks.",
        workedExample:
          "A senior dog with arthritis cannot stand for a full groom. You adapt: use a grooming sling or support strap, keep sessions shorter, pad the table, and schedule rest breaks. Reading the life stage changes the entire grooming plan — not just the haircut.",
        checks: [
          "Name the five AKC breed groups and give one coat-type characteristic of each.",
          "What three stress signals should you watch for before beginning a groom, and what does each tell you to do?",
          "Describe your sanitation sequence between dogs. Why does order matter?",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Core Skill — Bathing, Drying & Prep Technique",
        lesson:
          "Term 2 moves into the craft. You learn the prep work that determines whether a finished groom looks professional or rushed: brushing out the coat, checking for matting, trimming nails, cleaning ears, and expressing anal glands when appropriate. Bathing technique is not just soap and water — it is choosing the right shampoo for the coat and skin condition, controlling water temperature, and working product through to the skin. Drying is where groomers earn their reputation: a high-velocity dryer removes loose coat and straightens hair for a smooth finish, but it requires skill to avoid tangling or frightening the dog. You will practice these techniques on mannequins and supervised models before advancing to live-client dogs.",
        workedExample:
          "A matted Goldendoodle arrives. Options: shave the mats out (fastest, shortest coat), or brush-bathe-dry and demat (preserves coat length but may be painful). You assess mat severity, the dog's tolerance, and the owner's preference before choosing. There is no single right answer — there is the right answer for this dog today.",
        checks: [
          "Walk through your prep sequence before bathing. What happens if you skip brushing?",
          "When would you choose a high-velocity dryer versus a stand dryer, and why?",
          "A dog has mild matting behind the ears. Describe your approach and your reasoning.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Advanced Skill — Breed Profiles & Scissoring",
        lesson:
          "Term 3 is where grooming becomes a craft. You learn breed-standard cuts — the Poodle puppy cut, the Schnauzer pattern, the Cocker profile — and the scissoring and clipper techniques that produce them. Scissoring is a skill built over hundreds of hours: you learn to hold the scissors correctly, to follow the dog's natural lines, and to blend so the cut looks seamless. IPDG-302 is a safety gate; you must be signed off before advanced live-animal work. You also begin supervised live-client salon services this term, applying your technique to real dogs with real owners. Every live-client dog is graded against the Competency Rubric, and safety-critical rows are pass/fail.",
        workedExample:
          "A client wants a 'puppy cut' on their 6-month-old Labradoodle. There is no breed standard for a Doodle, so you negotiate: you show reference photos, agree on a length, and confirm the face and tail style. The consultation is part of the craft — a mismatched expectation is a failed groom even if the technique is perfect.",
        checks: [
          "What is the difference between a guard comb length and a snap-on comb? When would you use each?",
          "Describe the scissoring blend technique. Why do you blend rather than cut to a line?",
          "A live-client dog is stressed and pulling away during a face trim. What is your protocol?",

      },
      {
        title: "Capstone — Live Salon & Business Launch",
        lesson:
          "Term 4 is your capstone. You run the salon floor under instructor supervision: booking clients, greeting, consulting, grooming, and checking out — the full owner-operator cycle. The GRM-BIZ capstone is a panel review where you present your business plan: your service menu and pricing, your marketing strategy, your cost structure, and your first-year financial projection. You must demonstrate competency on every row of the rubric. Your practicum log — signed by your instructor — records the live-client hours and dog variety required for credential issue. By graduation you hold a Professional Dog Groomer Diploma and the business foundation to open your own salon or enter the workforce as a lead groomer.",

        title: "Foundation — Dog History, Breeds & Equipment",
        lesson:
          "You begin by understanding the dog as a species. Dogs descended from wolves through thousands of years of selective breeding, and that history explains why a Border Collie works differently than a Beagle. You will learn to identify the ten most important AKC breeds and their behavioral tendencies, because breed context shapes training approach. You will recognize training equipment — flat collars, martingales, slip leads, harnesses, long lines — and understand what each is for and when each is appropriate. You will also learn vaccination protocols and ADA service-animal guidelines, because a professional trainer must give new owners correct, legal, and safe guidance. PDT-201 is a safety gate before live-animal work.",
        workedExample:
          "A new owner asks whether a prong collar is right for their pulling Labrador. Rather than answering yes or no, you assess the dog's arousal level, the owner's handling skill, and the training goal. You explain the tool's purpose and risk, offer alternatives (front-clip harness, foundational loose-leash work), and let the owner decide with full information.",

        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Core Skill — Basic Obedience & Marker Training",
        lesson:
          "Term 2 builds your core craft: marker-based training. You learn to use a marker — a clicker or a consistent verbal word — to tell the dog the exact moment it did the right thing, then follow with a reward. This is the foundation of modern, humane training. You will teach sit, down, stay, recall, and loose-leash walking using markers, shaping, and capturing. You will learn to read canine body language — calming signals, stress, arousal — so you can adjust your session before the dog shuts down or blows up. Corrections, when needed, are minimal and fair: a withheld reward, a reset, never fear or pain. PDT-201 is the safety gate you must pass before live-animal work begins.",
        workedExample:
          "Teaching recall: start in a low-distraction room. Mark and reward every time the dog comes to you. Add distance gradually. Add low distraction (a toy on the floor). Only when recall is reliable in five contexts do you take it outdoors on a long line. Rushing to outdoor recall before indoor fluency is the most common training failure.",

        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Advanced Skill — Behavior Problems & Private Classes",
        lesson:
          "Term 3 addresses the problems that bring owners to trainers: leash reactivity, resource guarding, separation anxiety, jumping, barking. You learn to distinguish a training problem (the dog doesn't know the behavior) from a behavior problem (the dog is in an emotional state that prevents learning). The approach is different: a training problem is solved with repetition; a behavior problem requires a behavior-modification plan that changes the dog's emotional response. You will also learn to design private classes — structuring a 6-week curriculum, setting measurable goals, and writing handouts owners can follow. This term includes supervised live-client training sessions on the training floor.",
        workedExample:
          "A dog barks and lunges at other dogs on leash (leash reactivity). This is a behavior problem, not a training problem — the dog is over-threshold emotionally. Your plan: management (increase distance), counter-conditioning (other dog appears → high-value treat → dog learns other dog predicts good things), and gradual exposure at the dog's pace. Punishing the bark suppresses the symptom and worsens the emotion.",
        checks: [
          "How do you tell whether a jumping dog has a training problem or a behavior problem?",
          "Design a 6-week private-class curriculum for a dog that pulls on leash. What is the measurable goal?",

          "Term 4 is your capstone. You run supervised training sessions with live clients, building the practicum log required for credential issue. The TRN-BIZ capstone is a panel review where you present your training business plan: your class structure and pricing, your marketing channel (referrals, social media, vet partnerships), your insurance and liability waivers, and your continuing-education plan. Professional dog training requires lifelong learning — new methods, new research, new equipment — and your plan must show how you will stay current. By graduation you hold a Professional Dog Trainer Diploma and the business foundation to run private classes, group programs, or a training facility.",

You will trim nails without cutting the quick, clean ears without damaging the canal, and express anal glands when appropriate and permitted.

You begin by learning cat breeds and coat types: short-haired, long-haired, and the hairless breeds. More important than breed is temperament: you will learn to read a cat's emotional state — relaxed, tense, overstimulated, fearful — and to adjust your handling before the cat escalates to a bite or scratch. CAT-102 is a safety gate that must be signed off before live-animal work. You will learn the 'less is more' philosophy: a cat groom may be shorter than a dog groom, and pushing past the cat's tolerance is both dangerous and unprofessional.",

Most cats do not enjoy water, so bathing technique is about efficiency: warm (not hot) water, cat-safe shampoo, and a calm, firm hold. Drying is done with low-velocity air or towel-drying — a high-velocity dryer that works on dogs can terrify a cat. You will learn short-coat grooming (brush-out and nail trim), long-coat grooming (dematting, line brushing, and sanitary trim), and shave-down technique (using guards to remove matting safely). Nail trimming on a cat is different from a dog — you will learn the 'scruff and quick-clip' method and alternatives for cats who resist handling.",

        workedExample:
          "Your 3-year projection: Year 1 — one location, $280K revenue, break-even by month 9. Year 2 — add a second groomer and a group training program, $420K revenue, $60K profit. Year 3 — open a second location, $680K revenue, $120K profit. The numbers must be grounded in real market size, pricing, and capacity — not aspiration.",
        checks: [
          "Present your 3-year financial projection. What are your revenue assumptions?",
          "Describe your hiring plan. What do you look for, and how do you retain staff?",
          "What legal structure protects a multi-service pet-care business, and why?",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Capstone — PPC-BIZ & Enterprise Launch",
        lesson:
          "Term 4 is the most demanding capstone in the program. You will present a complete multi-service enterprise plan to an instructor panel: your service mix and pricing, your facility and staffing plan, your 3-year financial projection, your funding strategy, your marketing and customer-acquisition plan, and your legal and insurance framework. PPC-403, 405, 410 are safety gates that must be signed off. Your practicum log must show multi-service hours across salon, training, and sitting. By graduation you hold an Advanced Diploma — the terminal credential — and the complete foundation to launch, fund, staff, and scale a multi-service pet-care enterprise. This is the whole-person owner pathway: the craft, the business, and the personal readiness to sustain it.",
        workedExample:
          "Your capstone defense: the panel challenges your staffing cost assumption — 'You budget $15/hr for groomers, but the market is $18.' You must either adjust your numbers or justify why your compensation model (profit-sharing, not just hourly) will attract and retain talent at a comparable effective rate. The panel tests whether your plan survives contact with reality.",
        checks: [
          "Present your complete enterprise plan. Can you defend every number?",
          "How does your practicum log demonstrate multi-service competency?",
          "What is your exit or growth strategy: scale to a second location, franchise, or maximize one location?",
        ],
      },
    ],
    practice: [
      "Write your multi-service business vision in one page: services, facility, target market.",
      "Create a staffing plan for a multi-service facility: roles, headcount, and compensation model.",
      "Build a 3-year financial projection spreadsheet: revenue, costs, profit by month.",
      "Write standard operating procedures for intake that work across grooming, training, and sitting.",
      "Draft a funding plan: how much capital do you need, and what sources will you pursue?",
      "Design a marketing plan that promotes all three service lines without diluting your brand.",
      "Research the legal structure (LLC, S-corp) and insurance coverage for a multi-service pet business in your state.",
      "Write a personal-readiness plan: how will you manage stress, time, and well-being as a business owner?",
